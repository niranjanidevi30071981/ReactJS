component work: high spoeed view rendering

Life cycle of components system defind events
----------------------------------------------
mounting : component intialize and add to the page like constructor
Update : page state changes 
Unmounting: Removing the component from page

events
----------------
mounting events:- constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps(hook),render,componentdidmount
--------------------
Update events: static getDerivedStateFromProps(hook),shouldcompoentUpdate,render,getSnapshotbeforeupdate(compulsary return null other wise application will 
--------------
not procedure next step),componetdidupdate(root.unmount remove the page completely)

unMount:-simply remove the compoent  
-------------

submithandler(event)->event.preventdefault() prevent the action item default properties and and sumit the form to server using server event
this.setstate([fieldName]:fieldvalue):-fieldName control value i am assigning fieldvalue

quardinate rate position system

media querry using below options for-- impliment response web design API- using boostrap
-----------------

lg-4 large size
md:4 medium size screen
Xm-4 tablet
xs-4 mobile

content delivary network:- Across the globleuser is used to develop the application cloud environment provide some libraries we can use
-------------------------------

google->bootstrapCDN ->officialCDN and font awasomebootstrapcdn
applying boostrap :-reddy setup classes and reponsive web design

Node.js:-Writing server side code using javascript
Postback: 1 request and 1 response called post back

Routing API:-Request is not calling routing address directly ,it will call intermediate layer or frame work called Routing API(it will call two reasons
------------
Performance improvement and search engine optimization

routing library:- Reactive router split into two parts: Reactive native dom and reactive router native


Manage router have 3 classes:-Browser Router,hash router,memory router

Router tag exact is equivalent to domain name in url http://www.amanon.com
two types of routing can do in application static and dynamic [id] replace id with value using this sqare brackets

react js is not compiled its interpreted

Navigation link: just change the colour of the link while clicking or selecting.

Service driven architecture:- any type of service(like java,dotnet.. API) we can consume in the react application

* use params is in functional component not class component

Redux
-------------------------------
state:- certain point of time it will hold the value and change value 
redux:-single storage management process called redux(bank) stored data on client system
ANsaisql:used to get data from sql database
redux interact with 4 pillors 1)intial trigger(submit check)->2)meet bank manager->3)branch manager dispath check to right department->4) actual work
1.view 2.action 3.dispather 4. reducer
redux impliment two ways ,redux ,redux tool kit(latest version)
state is read only will not changen changes through action and dispather,reducer
in redux what we call table slice

functions
--------------------------
function is java is loosely coupled and convert type to upcosting or Promise type(promise) promise objects are 3 types of return in promise object a.Data b.Error c.Notification
in asynchronous programing,default programing is asyncronous programing

prioority banker added high value added service called technically using asynchronous programming

middle layer: sits in between lwo application layers(between two existing blocks) e: saga middleware between react and redux store application software name redux-saga

convert common function to generator function or saga using * symbol function*
multiple yield returns in generator function return more than one value return next value using next key word x.next()

how many pillors for saga: 3 pillors root(take note)->watcher(waitying to worker should take action)->worker(real work)

difference between saga and promisses(saga is the function and return promises)

hook
----------
life cycle events are adding to the functional component called life cycle hook
useState() hook not only change the state it also maintain the previous state value
useeffect() hook will do all these life cycle event activity(componnet didmount(),componnetdidupdate(),componentwillunmount()) practically used to get data from RESAT full services
useContext() nextedfunctions need to use in functions using useContext()(sending the component where ever you want)parent and child relationship functions

GRAPHQL
-----------
simplified communicatation with single facade and will do curd operations
facade pattern: is using impliment single layer to interact urls and network changes from react and restfull services
three componnets are in Graphql 1.query parser(query format and parsing) 2.schema(validation) 3.resolver function(connect api, db)

data types supporter: Scalar,object ,query,mutation,enum
type modifiers: int,float,string,id,boolean
string!(! symbol is using will not allow null values)
we need to configure the bapplication have to install graphql server
graphql application:- is the service side nodejs pure server application(node js,express web,graphql servers) like a full stack development application
graphql benifit is type safety
----------------------------------------
React JS testing 
----------------------------

Jest and engyme: Jest is testing framework ,assertion library and miocking library

Engyme: Testing utility for react make eassier to assert ,monipulate and traverse your react component
npm run test(run the test project)
update the snapshot click 'U'
